# Dice-Game
This code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a dice game. It generates random numbers between 1 and 6, updates the images of the dice on the page, and displays a message indicating the winner based on the roll values. "Draw" is displayed if both rolls are equal, otherwise it shows "Player 1 Wins" or "Player 2 Wins ".
